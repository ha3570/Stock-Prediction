# Stock-Prediction 
The "Stock Prediction Python Project Using Linear Regression and Averaging Techniques" is an endeavor aimed at forecasting stock prices by leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling. In this project, historical stock data is processed and analyzed to make future price predictions. Linear regression, a statistical modeling technique, is employed to identify potential trends and patterns within the historical data, which can help in understanding the stock's price movements.

Additionally, averaging techniques are applied to mitigate the impact of outliers and noise in the data, improving the accuracy of the predictions. By combining the power of linear regression with averaging methods, this project strives to create a more robust and reliable stock price prediction model.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It may also include the use of libraries and frameworks like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide investors and traders with insights into potential stock price movements, aiding them in making informed decisions in the financial markets.
